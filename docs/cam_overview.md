- Argument: Structured via goals/sub-goals linking clauses to requirements and metrics.
- Evidence: Metric measurements, pass/fail reports, and sensitivity analyses generated by the pipeline.
- Assets: CAM/GSN artifacts and generators live in `tools/cam`, `tools/gsn`, `artifacts/cam`, and `artifacts/gsn`.
- Interpretation: Review claims, inspect linked metrics, verify thresholds/assumptions, and check sensitivity results.
